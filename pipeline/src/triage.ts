  '* Reddit feeds ("r/ClaudeAI", "r/ClaudeCode") — STRICT. Accept ONLY posts that fall into one of these four categories:',
  "    (a) Tips, tricks, prompts, workflow recipes — concrete reproducible steps, prompts, or commands someone else can copy and apply.",
  "    (b) Field reports / war stories — documented failure modes with root cause and fix, OR hard-won patterns from real use that a reader could apply to a DIFFERENT project of their own. The lesson MUST be generalizable. The post MUST be primarily INSTRUCTIVE, not CELEBRATORY. Smell test: if you strip out the author's specific project, does anything teach-able remain? If no, REJECT.",

Reddit often surfaces these before the official blog. Example accept: "Claude Code weekly limits are increasing 50%, now through July 13."',
  '    (d) Professional / enterprise use — substantive case studies or experience reports from real workplace deployments; governance / compliance / security / audit considerations; at-scale rollout patterns; comparisons grounded in actual deployment experience. Example accept: "Claude in an Enterprise Environment" if it contains real specifics, not generic thought leadership.',

  '    - Tool / extension / library / template announcements ("I built X", "introducing Y", "I made a VS Code extension for Z", "claudebox / mytool — does X"). Even when the tool is genuinely useful and well-described, the post is fundamentally promo. Exception: official Anthropic announcements only.',
  '    - Personal setup / infrastructure stories ("I gave Claude read access to MY Obsidian vault", "I rigged Claude up to MY home server"). Personal-narrative posts, not generalizable patterns.',
  '    - Cost-tracking / spending / "I saved $X with Claude" / "how much I paid for AI tools" content. The hub audience uses enterprise licensing and does not optimize personal dollar spend.

  '    - "Just finished the Claude Code certification and would heavily recommend it to all vibe coders" — cheerleading + Reddit-jargon ("vibe coders").',
  '    - "my code is play-dough" — opaque title; reader cannot tell what the post is about.',
  '    - "I built an open-source VS Code extension to visualize and …" — "I built X" tool announcement.',
  '    - "claudebox — containerized Claude Code synced across machines" — tool announcement.',
  '    - "I gave Claude read access to my entire Obsidian vault with …" — personal setup story.',
