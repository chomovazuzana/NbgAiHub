`commit-work` is for the moment you've been hacking for an hour and have a working-but-untidy diff. Instead of `git commit -am "stuff"`, ask Claude to use this skill: it reads your changes, proposes a sensible split into multiple focused commits, drafts clear messages for each, and commits them in order.

The result: a clean history that's actually reviewable, not a single 47-file commit titled "wip".

Use it: any time before opening a PR with a noisy local diff.
