`/team` is the team's flagship skill for delivering an end-to-end change in one sitting. You give it a request; it runs through ten phases (refine → scan → investigate → plan → design → implement → review → validate deps → build tests → integrate-verify) and reports back with an AC-by-AC verdict.

When to reach for it: a request that's bigger than "fix this one line" but smaller than "multi-week project". The sweet spot is "deliver a feature this week".

When NOT to reach for it: trivial fixes (use plain Claude Code) or long multi-phase work (use GSD).
