ai_summary: A family of commands (gsd-new-project, gsd-progress, gsd-do, gsd-next, etc.) for managing multi-week Claude Code projects with persistent state in a `.planning/` folder.
when_to_use: Use this for multi-week projects where you'll pause, resume, and need an audit trail. Persistent `.planning/` folder with roadmap and per-phase artefacts. Overkill for one-sitting work — try `/team` instead.

The `gsd-*` skill family is the heaviest workflow option in the team's toolbox — for projects that genuinely span weeks or months, not one sitting.

What you get: a persistent `.planning/` folder with roadmap, milestones, per-phase artefacts (discuss / spec / plan / execute / verify / secure), and an audit trail. Pick it up next week and Claude remembers exactly where you left off.

When it's right:

- Long horizon (weeks/months)
- Multiple collaborators
- Traceability matters
- You'll pause and resume

When it's overkill: one-off scripts, single-sitting prototypes — use plain Claude Code or `/team` instead.

Common entry points: `/gsd-new-project`, `/gsd-progress`, `/gsd-do`, `/gsd-next`, `/gsd-help`. See `/hub-glossary gsd` for the broader framework explanation.
