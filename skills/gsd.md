The `gsd-*` skill family is the heaviest workflow option in the team's toolbox — for projects that genuinely span weeks or months, not one sitting.

What you get: a persistent `.planning/` folder with roadmap, milestones, per-phase artefacts (discuss / spec / plan / execute / verify / secure), and an audit trail. Pick it up next week and Claude remembers exactly where you left off.

When it's right:

- Long horizon (weeks/months)
- Multiple collaborators
- Traceability matters
- You'll pause and resume

When it's overkill: one-off scripts, single-sitting prototypes — use plain Claude Code or `/team` instead.

Common entry points: `/gsd-new-project`, `/gsd-progress`, `/gsd-do`, `/gsd-next`, `/gsd-help`. See `/hub-glossary gsd` for the broader framework explanation.
