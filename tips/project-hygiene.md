ai_summary: When Claude starts making things up, the bug is almost always in your project, not the model. Stale CLAUDE.md sections, leftover scratch files, orphaned READMEs — Claude reads everything and the noise leaks into its answers.

When Claude starts confidently citing functions that don't exist, paths that were deleted last month, or rules from a stack you migrated away from — the bug is rarely in the model. It's in your project.

Claude reads *everything* it can see in your folder: CLAUDE.md, README, every markdown file you forgot was there, every `.bak` you left lying around, every commented-out block of old code. It doesn't know what's load-bearing and what's stale. So if you keep three drafts of the same architecture doc, two of which are wrong, Claude is going to confidently cite the wrong one half the time. That's not hallucination — that's exactly what you'd expect from a careful reader given contradictory inputs.

The fix is project hygiene, and it pays for itself in the first afternoon:

- **CLAUDE.md stays under two pages.** If you find yourself writing a third page, you're explaining things Claude could figure out from the code. Cut it. The CLAUDE.md is for non-obvious rules and conventions, not a project history.
- **No stale scratch files at the repo root.** `scratch.md`, `notes-from-meeting.md`, `tmp.py`, `wip-old.ts` — Claude reads them. If they're not load-bearing, delete them. If they are, put them somewhere structured (e.g. `docs/`) and reference them from the CLAUDE.md.
- **Old READMEs get rewritten, not appended.** If the project changed direction six months ago, the README should say what the project does *now*. Don't keep two paragraphs that describe a feature you killed.
- **Dead code gets deleted, not commented out.** Modern git remembers everything. Commented-out blocks just confuse readers (Claude included) about whether the code is "off" or "removed".
- **One source of truth per fact.** If the deployment command lives in CLAUDE.md, the README, and a tip file, all three will drift apart. Pick one canonical place and link to it from the others.

A useful diagnostic: when Claude says something wrong, ask "where in this folder would someone read that?" and go look. If you find the misleading content, you've found the bug. Delete or rewrite it. Next session is cleaner.

This isn't about being tidy for its own sake. It's about respecting the fact that Claude treats your project as the ground truth. Garbage in, garbage out applies in both directions.
