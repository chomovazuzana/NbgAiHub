# Decision log

Append-only. Each entry permanent. When a decision is superseded, add a new entry that supersedes it — never edit prior entries.

## 2026-05-18 — Reframe "marketplace" → "hub" / "field manual"

**Decision:** The project is conceptually a *hub* (or *field manual*), not a *marketplace*.

**Why:** "Marketplace" implies a catalog of items / transactions. What we're actually building is a curated journey for newcomers framed around the team's hard-won lessons. Framing shapes the information architecture.

**Alternatives considered:** Keep "marketplace" framing (rejected: misleads contributors into thinking link-list completeness matters more than curation).

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Triangle architecture: GitHub repo as CMS + Astro Starlight web UI + Claude Code skill

**Decision:** Single GitHub repo holds markdown as the source of truth. Astro Starlight builds a static web UI from it. A Claude Code skill plugin reads the same content to expose `/hub-*` commands inside the terminal.

**Why:** One source of truth, two surfaces. Markdown is native to both Claude Code and human contributors. GitOps gives versioning and PR-based curation for free. The skill is the differentiator (lives inside the tool people use daily); the web UI is table stakes for first impressions and stakeholders.

**Alternatives considered:** Azure web app (rejected: contributor friction, no Claude-native access), GitHub Pages markdown-only (rejected: insufficient polish for promotion-grade demo), Notion / Confluence (rejected: not Claude-readable, not git-versionable, brand mismatch).

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Curated RSS, not auto-aggregated

**Decision:** GitHub Action fetches RSS feeds daily into `/news/incoming` (staging). Items are promoted to `/news/published` only via PR (manual editorial review).

**Why:** Auto-aggregation becomes noise within a week and erodes trust. The promotion step is itself a quality signal. Cost: a few minutes of editorial review per week. Benefit: zero broken-trust-on-day-one risk.

**Alternatives considered:** Live RSS widget (rejected: noise, no editorial control), no news at all (rejected: misses one of the most-asked-for content types).

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Astro Starlight as static site generator

**Decision:** Use Astro Starlight to build the web UI.

**Why:** Clean dev-docs aesthetic that doesn't read as AI slop; built-in tag filtering, sidebar nav, dark mode, search, and MDX; reference users (Cloudflare, Tauri, Biome) give it credibility; low learning curve for contributors who already know markdown.

**Alternatives considered:** Docusaurus (heavier, React-first feel), MkDocs Material (Python-flavored toolchain), Nextra (Next.js weight without enough payoff for a static site).

**Status:** accepted; revisit if a specific feature gap surfaces.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Skill is the differentiator; web UI is table stakes

**Decision:** Prioritize the Claude Code skill plugin as the primary value driver. The web UI exists for stakeholder demos and first-visit discovery, not as the daily-use surface.

**Why:** Internal portals die because nobody bookmarks them. A skill lives inside the tool teammates use daily. Adoption follows.

**Status:** accepted. Drives MVP prioritization — the skill must be functional in the MVP even if the web UI is sparse.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Project documentation pattern: SCOPE.md (mutable) + DECISIONS.md (append-only) + project CLAUDE.md (wiring)

**Decision:** Track project evolution with two living docs — `SCOPE.md` (always reflects current truth, edited in place) and `DECISIONS.md` (this file — append-only, immutable record). Project `CLAUDE.md` auto-imports SCOPE.md and encodes rules for when to update each file.

**Why:** Manager demo needs a chronological narrative of how we thought about this. Future Claude sessions need fresh context without paying tokens for an ever-growing history file. Splitting mutable state from immutable history gives both.

**Alternatives considered:** GSD `.planning/` structure (rejected: heavyweight for pre-MVP exploration), single CLAUDE.md as scope source (rejected: CLAUDE.md is for agent behavior, not project state).

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Onboarding guide is complementary, not duplicative

**Decision:** The hub does **not** absorb or rewrite the existing Onboarding guide at `556lowcodenocode.github.io/Onboarding`. Instead, the hub provides three things the guide doesn't: (1) *curated journeys* (Day 1, Week 1, by-role), (2) a *living catalog* (skills, tips, news, glossary), (3) a *Claude-Code-native skill* (`/hub-*`). Every hub page deep-links into the relevant guide section.

**Why:** The Onboarding guide is the encyclopedia (~12,000 words, 11 sections, comprehensive reference). The hub is the journey + catalog + skill layer. Different shapes, different consumption patterns. Duplicating content would create drift and double the maintenance burden for the same team.

**Alternatives considered:** Absorb the guide into the hub (rejected: existing guide is already published, maintained, linkable — moving it would break inbound links and bury 12K words of work). Maintain in parallel as the same content (rejected: drift).

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Five user-facing pillars + cross-cutting substrate

**Decision:** The hub has five user-facing pillars: **Skills catalog**, **Tips & Tricks**, **News**, **Curated journeys**, **Glossary + Reference**. The substrate that underlies all five: GitHub repo as CMS, Astro Starlight web UI, hub-as-skill plugin, shared content shape.

**Why:** Locking the pillars locks the IA. Naming Tips, Journeys, and Glossary explicitly (not just "skills + news + onboarding") catches what was missing from the original three-pillar framing. The substrate is what makes the pillars composable — same plumbing for every pillar.

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Shared content shape across all pillars

**Decision:** Every piece of hub content — skill entry, tip, news item, journey step, glossary term, reference page — uses one common frontmatter schema:

```yaml
---
type: skill | tip | news | journey-step | glossary | reference
title: ...
audience: [beginner | advanced | both]
topics: [setup, workflow, github, mcp, claudemd, ...]
internal: false
authored: 2026-05-18
last_reviewed: 2026-05-18
external_link: ...      # for skills, news
deeper_link: ...        # to a section of the Onboarding guide
ai_summary: ...         # auto-generated; optional
---
```

**Why:** One filter, one tag system, one search index, one set of `/hub-*` commands work across every pillar with no per-pillar plumbing. Adding a new pillar later (e.g., war stories, post-mortems) inherits the same machinery for free.

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Tips & Tricks are a distinct pillar from Skills

**Decision:** Tips & Tricks (patterns, prompts, gotchas, workflow recipes) are a separate pillar from Skills (installable packaged instruction sets distributed via plugin marketplace).

**Why:** Different content shapes, different consumption patterns. A tip is *read and apply manually* (e.g., "use `Esc Esc` to stop and edit your last prompt"). A skill is *install once and invoke* (e.g., `/team`). Mixing them obscures discovery — newcomers don't know whether they're being told to *do* something or *install* something.

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Hub ships as its own Claude Code skill plugin

**Decision:** The hub repo includes its own plugin manifest. Installing the hub = `/plugin marketplace add chomovazuzana/NbgAiHub` followed by `/plugin install hub@…`. The plugin exposes `/hub`, `/hub-search <query>`, `/hub-news`, `/hub-tips`, `/hub-skills`, `/hub-onboard <journey>`, and adds a CLAUDE.md fragment so the local agent knows the hub exists. Updates via `/plugin marketplace update`.

**Why:** One command bootstraps a colleague into the hub. Aligns naturally with Day 1 Step 5 ("install the team plugin marketplace"). Reinforces the "skill is the differentiator" decision — the hub *is* a skill that exposes everything else.

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Hybrid glossary: canonical page + inline anchor links

**Decision:** Glossary terms live on a canonical `/glossary` page with anchors (`/glossary#claudemd`, `/glossary#mcp`, etc.). Across other pages, terms link to those anchors when first mentioned. No definitions duplicated inline.

**Why:** One canonical definition (no drift) + contextual access from anywhere in the hub + the glossary page itself is discoverable/searchable as its own asset.

**Alternatives considered:** Flat page only (rejected: forces context switch every time a reader hits a new term), inline-only definitions (rejected: drift across pages, no single place to skim all terms).

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — AI strategy: build-time + Claude skill, not web runtime

**Decision:** AI lives in two places in the system, and explicitly **not** in a third:

| Where | What | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Build-time (GitHub Action) | RSS triage, auto-tagging, summarization via Azure OpenAI | Earns its keep: dedup + tag + summarize at scale |
| Runtime — Claude Code skill | `/hub-ask`, `/hub-search` use the user's existing Claude session for semantic queries over hub content | Zero infra; the user's Claude IS the chatbot |
| Runtime — website | **Nothing** | Keeps the static site fast, free to host, no backend |

**Why:** A chatbot on the website would be inferior to the Claude Code skill that already serves the same purpose with full session context. Build-time AI runs once daily, cheaply, and the output is reviewable in a PR. Azure OpenAI for the build-time pipeline aligns with bank policy for any AI inference in shipped code, even when processing public RSS data — sets the right precedent for newcomers reading the system.

**Alternatives considered:** Live chatbot widget on the website (rejected: duplicates the Claude skill, requires backend), client-side embeddings search in the browser (rejected: needs an embeddings index served somewhere, complexity not justified for MVP).

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Repo: chomovazuzana/NbgAiHub, public, single-repo

**Decision:** Initial home of the hub is `github.com/chomovazuzana/NbgAiHub` (personal account, not team org). Repo is **public** to enable free GitHub Pages on the personal tier. **Single repo** holds everything: content markdown, Astro Starlight site, GitHub Action for RSS, and the Claude Code plugin manifest.

**Why:** Bootstrap mode. Personal account lowers permission/coordination overhead during the design and MVP phase. Public visibility is required for free Pages on personal tier; aligns with the "publish public-safe onboarding content, gate bank-specific later" pattern. Single-repo keeps content + code + plugin coherent and easy to PR.

**Permanent implications of public-on-personal:**
- **Public-safe content only.** Bank-confidential material cannot live here, even gated by the `internal: true` frontmatter flag — that flag is reserved for *team-internal-but-not-confidential* content (e.g., internal tool links, team Slack channels by name).
- **PR contribution** flow runs through the repo owner; team contributors are added as collaborators or fork-and-PR.
- **Migration path** for the day we need real gating: (a) transfer to a team org and upgrade to GitHub Team, or (b) add a private supplement repo whose content the public hub does not reference.

**Alternatives considered:** Team org `556LowCodeNoCode` from day one (rejected: heavier coordination overhead before MVP exists; team org name doesn't reflect hub branding). Private personal repo (rejected: free Pages requires public on personal tier; premature spend on Pro). Two-repo split — content + code (rejected: complexity not justified for MVP).

**Status:** SUPERSEDED on 2026-05-18 by the entry below — repo will be PRIVATE.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Repo visibility: PRIVATE (supersedes prior public decision)

**Decision:** `chomovazuzana/NbgAiHub` will be **private**, not public. Naming (`NbgAiHub`), location (`chomovazuzana`), and single-repo structure from the prior entry stand; only visibility flips.

**Why:** User override — preference to iterate without world-readable visibility during pre-MVP design phase.

**Implications:**
- **GitHub Pages from a private repo on a personal account requires GitHub Pro** ($4/month or $40/year). Without Pro, the static site cannot be deployed via free Pages — we'd need alternative hosting (Vercel free tier, Netlify free tier, Cloudflare Pages) or defer deployment.
- **Bank-internal content can technically live here** since the repo is not world-readable. However, it still resides under a *personal* GitHub account, not under bank-managed infrastructure. Bank compliance review may be required before storing any real internal material.
- **Team contributors** must be added as individual collaborators (no public fork-and-PR flow available).
- **Hosting decision is now an open question** in SCOPE.md (GitHub Pro for Pages vs. alternative host vs. defer hosting until later).

**Status:** accepted; visibility now private, hosting strategy open.

---

## 2026-05-18 — RSS library: `@rowanmanning/feed-parser` (supersedes refined-request Assumption A6)

**Decision:** The RSS pipeline uses `@rowanmanning/feed-parser` ^2.x — **not** `rss-parser` as originally assumed in the refined request (A6).

**Why:** Phase 3a investigation found `rss-parser` (rbren/rss-parser on GitHub) is effectively unmaintained — no npm release in ~3 years, ~20 open 2024 bug reports, no response from maintainer. `@rowanmanning/feed-parser` is actively maintained, tested against ~40 real-world feeds, throws typed `INVALID_FEED` errors, and forces a cleaner fetch/parse seam for testing. Equivalent functionality, better engineering hygiene, no migration cost since we hadn't written code yet at the time of the swap.

**Alternatives considered:** Stick with `rss-parser` (rejected: technical debt from day one, foreseeable upgrade pain), `feedparser` (rejected: older callback-style API), hand-rolling (rejected: scope creep).

**Status:** accepted; implemented in `pipeline/src/parse.ts`. Validated end-to-end on 2026-05-18 — parsed all 5 feeds, including the Atom-format Claude Code releases feed, without issue.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Test framework: Vitest 4.x (upgraded from 2.1.9)

**Decision:** Upgrade test framework from Vitest 2.1.9 (originally scaffolded) to Vitest ^4.1.6.

**Why:** Phase 8 dependency validator surfaced **5 moderate-severity security advisories** in vitest 2.x transitive deps (`vite`, `esbuild`, `@vitest/mocker`, `vite-node`). All resolved in vitest ^4.1.6. Vulnerabilities are dev-tooling-only (do not ship in production GH Action runtime), but were trivially fixable in the same workflow run.

**Cost of the upgrade:** Two test files needed adjustment — `tests/azure-client.test.ts` (vitest 4 no longer auto-applies `[[Construct]]` semantics to arrow-function mocks; switched to `function` expressions for newable mocks) and `tests/write.test.ts` (a pre-existing latent bug surfaced — gray-matter's default `js-yaml` engine auto-converts YAML 1.1 date strings to JS `Date` objects, breaking the `authored: "2026-05-18"` string assertion; switched gray-matter to use the `yaml` engine for round-trip parity with our producer). No production source modules changed.

**Result:** 88/88 tests pass, 0 vulnerabilities (production + dev), typecheck + lint clean.

**Alternatives considered:** Defer the upgrade as a follow-up task (rejected by user during workflow — fix-now keeps the repo clean from day one); switch to Jest (rejected: heavier TS configuration, no compelling reason).

**Status:** accepted; installed and verified 2026-05-18.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Astro 6 + Starlight 0.39 (supersedes earlier Astro 5.x assumption)

**Decision:** The web UI workstream uses **Astro `^6.x`** + **`@astrojs/starlight` `^0.39.x`**, not Astro 5.x as initially assumed in `docs/refined-requests/astro-starlight-site.md` A1/A2.

**Why:** Phase 3a investigation found that Astro 6 went stable on 2026-03-10 and Starlight 0.38 *dropped* Astro 5 support; Starlight 0.39 (released 2026-05-07) requires Astro 6. The earlier-assumed "Astro 5.x + latest Starlight" combo is mutually exclusive in mid-2026.

**Migration cost:** zero. The site workspace is greenfield — no Astro 5 code to migrate from. The supersession is purely a version pin update at scaffold time.

**Cross-references:**
- Original assumption file: `docs/refined-requests/astro-starlight-site.md` A1/A2 (now updated in place with strikethrough-and-redirect to this entry).
- Investigation: `docs/reference/investigation-astro-site.md` §1.
- DECISIONS.md entry that locked Starlight as the SSG: "Astro Starlight as static site generator" — that decision stands; only the version pin shifts.

**Status:** accepted.

---

## 2026-05-18 — RSS triage: source-aware prompt + editor_confidence field

**Decision:** Tighten the triage admission criteria in two ways:

1. **Source-aware system prompt.** The triage LLM now receives explicit per-source rules in addition to a single global persona. Each of the five seed feeds has its own ACCEPT/REJECT clauses:
   - **Anthropic news / Claude Code releases** — lean permissive; reject pure infra/billing patch notes and regional-only launches.
   - **Simon Willison** — accept Claude/Anthropic/MCP content and universally applicable LLM techniques; reject competitor-only deep dives and meta-blogging.
   - **Hacker News (Claude/Anthropic)** — judge the linked article, not the thread; explicitly reject "Claude" false positives (Claude Shannon, the French given name, unrelated products), Ask-HN/Show-HN/poll threads, and paywalled articles.
   - **r/ClaudeAI** — STRICT. Accept tips, tricks, prompts, workflow recipes, gotchas, and **field reports / war stories that teach a reusable lesson**. Reject questions, "look what I built" promo, complaints/rants, screenshots without prose, memes, polls, billing/account drama.

2. **Cross-cutting rules** apply to every source: English only; substance threshold (must be summarizable in two useful sentences); no retired-model content (Claude 2 / 3.0); **when in doubt, reject**.

3. **New `editor_confidence` JSON field.** The triage response now includes `editor_confidence: "high" | "medium" | "low"` alongside `relevant`, `audience`, `topics`, `summary`. This is the model's self-rated certainty in its own verdict and is propagated into both:
   - Item frontmatter (now 13 keys instead of 12)
   - PR body (each bullet shows `[confidence: <level>]` so reviewers can skim and concentrate attention on borderline items)

**Why:** PR #1's first operational run admitted 43 items — too permissive for the hub's "signal over coverage" framing. The original prompt was a one-liner ("relevant to bank colleagues learning Claude Code") with no reject criteria, no source differentiation, and no confidence signal. Tightening the prompt is the cheapest possible lever; adding source branches piggybacks on the existing `Feed:` line we already pass to the model; the confidence field gives the editor visibility into the model's own uncertainty without changing the binary admit/reject flow.

**Why field reports were kept in:** war stories ("here's what broke when I tried X in production") match the project's *"what I wish I knew a year ago"* tone better than clean recipe-style tips. Often the highest-signal posts on Reddit.

**r/ClaudeAI ACCEPT expanded (same day, 2026-05-18):** the initial r/ClaudeAI block allowed only two categories — tips/tricks and field reports. User flagged two real-world examples the rules would have wrongly rejected — *"Claude Code weekly limits are increasing 50%, now through July 13"* and *"Claude in an Enterprise Environment"*. The block now names **four** ACCEPT categories explicitly:
- **(a) Tips, tricks, prompts, workflow recipes** — concrete reproducible steps.
- **(b) Field reports / war stories** — documented failure modes with root cause and fix.
- **(c) Platform news** — factual reporting of operational changes (rate limits, pricing, new model availability, feature rollouts, deprecations, outage post-mortems). Reddit often surfaces these before the official blog, which is why the category is worth admitting despite the strict framing.
- **(d) Professional / enterprise use** — substantive case studies, governance / compliance / security discussions, at-scale deployment patterns, comparisons grounded in actual deployment experience. Especially load-bearing for the hub's audience — bank colleagues are literally in an enterprise environment.

The REJECT list was extended in the same edit to keep the categories tight: now also rejects vendor pitches disguised as discussion, generic LinkedIn-style thought leadership with no specifics, and pure speculation about how big-company-X uses Claude with no inside source. Scope of (c) and (d): r/ClaudeAI only; HN's "big news / major moves / breakthroughs" clause already covers platform news from the wider press angle, so duplicating it there would only add noise.

**Cost of the change:** ~30 lines of code across `triage.ts`, `frontmatter.ts`, `pr.ts`, `types.ts`. Test suite grows from 88 → 93 (5 new tests covering source-aware-prompt assertions, confidence preservation, and PR confidence markers). No production source restructuring; the JSON contract is the only ABI break, and it's an additive field.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Per-source prompt lookup via `rss-sources.json` schema (rejected: heavier — feeds are already named, the model can branch on the `Feed:` line for free).
- Post-LLM topic allowlist filtering (rejected: premature; let the prompt do the work, revisit if PR volume stays noisy).
- Skip the confidence field, rely on a tighter binary verdict (rejected by user: confidence buys cheap PR-review ergonomics).
- Recency cutoff at triage stage (rejected: already handled by feed pagination + dedup).

**Status:** accepted; implemented and tested 2026-05-18. Will be validated against the next daily run.

---

## 2026-05-18 — Reddit triage tightening round 2: generalizability, scannability, anti-promo

**Decision:** Significant tightening of the Reddit-group rules in `SYSTEM_PROMPT`, driven by user review of the 21 admits in PR #3. Twelve of those admits (≈57%) were judged borderline or wrong by the user. Encoding the rejection patterns as explicit prompt rules + anchored examples.

**Rule additions:**

1. **Field-report rule sharpened** — must be *generalizable to a DIFFERENT project*, must be *primarily instructive, not celebratory*. Smell test: strip out the author's specific project; does anything teachable remain? If no, reject. Resolves the "Claude Code helped me bring my dead passion project back to life" pattern.

2. **New cross-cutting rule (5): title scannability.** The TITLE alone must be self-describing to a bank colleague who doesn't follow r/ClaudeAI / r/ClaudeCode memes. Opaque titles ("I didn't think this was possible", "my code is play-dough", "playing with X"), inside-joke titles ("DystopiaBench / Claude is still the only one I'd trust with nuclear codes"), and teaser-style framing get rejected regardless of body substance. Reasoning: users scan a list — if they'd skip the title, the item has no surface area.

3. **Six new Reddit REJECT categories:**
   - Celebratory personal-project posts (passion projects, side hustles, hobby apps, "look what Claude did for MY thing")
   - Tool / extension / library / template announcements ("I built X", "introducing Y", "claudebox", "VS Code extension") — even when well-described; the post exists to promote
   - Personal setup / infrastructure stories ("I gave Claude access to MY vault / notes / server")
   - Cost-tracking / spending / "I saved $X" content — bank uses enterprise licensing, dollar-spend is not the audience's concern
   - Reddit subculture jargon ("vibe coders", "vibe coded", "low-effort coder", subreddit catchphrases) in titles or framing
   - Feedback-solicitation posts ("roast my X") — these are questions in disguise

4. **Explicit clarification kept ACCEPT:** capability-driven model-selection content (when to use Opus vs Sonnet vs Haiku for task-fit reasons) stays. Only *cost-driven* model-selection is out. The bank cares about correct usage, not optimization.

5. **Eleven anchored REJECT examples** baked into the prompt, drawn from actual PR #3 titles the user flagged: passion project, dog walks, dollar tracking, DystopiaBench, certification cheerleading, code-is-play-dough, VS Code extension promo, claudebox tool, Obsidian vault setup, "I didn't think this was possible", "playing with Jupyter playbooks".

**Why anchor examples in the prompt:** the model demonstrated in PRs #2 and #3 that abstract rules ("reject promo") were interpreted too narrowly. Naming real titles forces the model to pattern-match against concrete shapes, not its own loose interpretation.

**Prompt size impact:** ~30 lines added to SYSTEM_PROMPT (now ~95 lines, ~1700 tokens). Well within the model's effective system-prompt context; temperature=0 keeps it deterministic.

**Cost impact:** none — same number of items triaged, same model, same temperature.

**Status:** accepted; deployed in the same workflow_dispatch run that produces PR #4.

---

## 2026-05-18 — RSS cron pinned to 05:00 UTC (= 08:00 Europe/Athens DST)

**Decision:** Daily cron changed from `0 6 * * *` (06:00 UTC) to `0 5 * * *` (05:00 UTC). At today's date (2026-05-18, DST active in Athens, UTC+3) this lands at **08:00 Europe/Athens**. In winter (Athens UTC+2) it will land at 07:00 Athens.

**Why:** User asked for the PR to be ready at 8am their local time. GH Actions cron is UTC-only and does not follow DST — we pin one fixed UTC time and accept the one-hour drift between summer and winter. Picking summer-DST as the anchor was deliberate: the project is in active development now, so "feels right" matters more than the winter-correctness it would have if we picked the winter offset.

**Alternatives considered:**
- 8am UTC fixed (rejected: lands at 11am Athens summer — too late for "PR ready at start of day").
- Use a third-party scheduler that respects timezone (rejected: extra infra for a one-line cron change).
- Run twice (once for winter, once for summer with overlapping disabled) (rejected: over-engineered for a one-hour drift).

**Synced documents:** workflow YAML, CLAUDE.md repo-layout table, SCOPE.md "Editorial cadence" line, SECRETS.md cadence section, project-design.md ASCII diagram + YAML snippet, project-functions.md F1 description. Historical artifacts (refined-requests, phase plans, investigation, integration-verification, code-review, codebase-scans) deliberately left unchanged — they are point-in-time snapshots.

**Status:** accepted; deployed via the same commit as the feed-list pivot below.

---

## 2026-05-18 — RSS feed list pivot + source-group prompt + confidence tuning

**Decision:** Three coupled changes to the RSS pipeline, applied together:

1. **Feed list pivot — 5 → 5 feeds, but a different 5.** Final list:
   - **Reddit group:** r/ClaudeAI (kept), r/ClaudeCode (new)
   - **Major tech / AI news group:** Hacker News frontpage (now unfiltered — replaces the earlier `?q=Claude+OR+...` Claude-keyword variant), Wired AI tag feed, The Verge full firehose.
   - **Dropped:** Anthropic news (RSS feed deleted by Anthropic — returned 404 on the just-completed PR #2 run; no replacement URL discoverable). Claude Code GitHub releases (`releases.atom`). Simon Willison's blog.

2. **Source-group prompt structure.** The SYSTEM_PROMPT in `pipeline/src/triage.ts` no longer enumerates rules per individual feed name — it now enumerates rules per *group*, with member feeds listed in the group header. Two groups:
   - **Reddit group** — same four ACCEPT categories established on 2026-05-18 (tips/tricks, field reports, platform news, professional/enterprise use). Rules apply to both r/ClaudeAI and r/ClaudeCode.
   - **Major tech / AI news group** — new ACCEPT/REJECT criteria for *professional industry news and breakthrough AI developments*. ACCEPT: major model launches from any significant lab; capability breakthroughs (benchmarks, novel architectures, agentic milestones); strategic moves (large acquisitions, partnerships at scale, key personnel moves); regulatory/policy news with concrete industry impact; significant safety/security incidents; new developer-facing platforms from major AI labs. REJECT: consumer gadget reviews, smart-speaker stories, marketing fluff, opinion pieces, vague "AI will change everything" thought leadership, niche/regional news, small-seed startup funding stories, gaming/entertainment/automotive/crypto/political content using AI as keyword, articles where AI is a tangential paragraph, paywalled previews, "Claude" name false positives (Claude Shannon, French given name), pure Ask-HN/Show-HN/poll threads.

3. **Confidence-prompt tuning.** PR #2 returned all 24 admits as `confidence: high` — the prompt didn't give the model strong enough reasons to differentiate. Updated the `editor_confidence` field description to: *"RESERVE 'high' for verdicts where you would stake your reputation. Use 'medium' whenever you have ANY reservation. Use 'low' only when you are essentially guessing. When in doubt about confidence, go LOWER, not higher."* Goal: produce a useful spread across high/medium/low so the editor can focus PR review attention on borderline items.

**Why:**

- The Anthropic feed is a structural loss, not a fixable URL change. The other 4 feeds + HN frontpage will catch most major Anthropic announcements via repost.
- Replacing Claude-keyword-filtered HN with unfiltered HN frontpage shifts filtering responsibility from a string-match `?q=` URL parameter to the LLM. More expensive (more items triaged) but catches breakthroughs that don't mention "Claude" by name (e.g., a new OpenAI model, a major regulatory action, a major acquisition).
- Adding Wired AI and The Verge widens the breakthrough-news net beyond developer-centric sources. Bank colleagues read these too. The Verge firehose is noisy by design — the new REJECT list is built to filter the gadget/gaming/entertainment majority.
- Dropping Claude Code releases (`releases.atom`) and Simon Willison loses two high-signal sources. User direction was explicit ("take what i told u 2reddit + 3 sites"). Documented here so the trade is visible — easy to re-add either if signal loss is felt in subsequent runs.

**Alternatives considered:**
- Keep all old feeds + add the 3 new ones (rejected by user — wanted a clean cutover, not stacking).
- Replace HN firehose with an AI-tag-filtered Verge URL (rejected: user wanted full firehose, LLM filters).
- Drop the confidence field entirely now that it returned all "high" (rejected: tuning the prompt is cheaper than removing the field; if the tuning fails to spread the distribution, revisit later).

**Cost implication:** the Verge firehose + unfiltered HN frontpage will roughly double the daily item count vs. the prior run (66 items → expected ~120-180). Azure OpenAI cost per item ~$0.001 → daily run cost ~$0.10-0.20. Acceptable.

**Status:** accepted; deployed 2026-05-18. Will be validated against the next workflow_dispatch run (PR #3).

## 2026-05-18 — RSS pipeline verified operational end-to-end

**Decision:** The RSS curation pipeline is acknowledged **OPERATIONAL** following the first successful end-to-end run on 2026-05-18. Acceptance criteria are MET in production, not just on local test runs.

**Why this entry exists:** The audit trail benefits from a permanent marker that distinguishes "pipeline coded" from "pipeline working in real life." Phase 10's per-AC verdict was based on tests + lint + typecheck, all green. This entry captures the *operational* validation that's qualitatively different — real RSS feeds parsed, real Azure OpenAI calls made and JSON-mode responses validated, real `gh pr create` flow executed, real PR opened.

**Evidence:**
- Workflow run `26047997638` on `chomovazuzana/NbgAiHub`, branch `main`, triggered via `workflow_dispatch`, completed in 2m46s with conclusion `success`.
- PR #1 (`News triage 2026-05-18`) opened automatically, branch `news-triage/2026-05-18-2604799`, with 43 relevant items across 4 of 5 feeds. Anthropic news contributed 0 items this run (either no new items or all judged irrelevant — per-feed-non-fatal contract working).
- All 4 Azure secrets and the "Allow GH Actions to create/approve PRs" repo toggle wired via `gh` CLI; SECRETS.md §3 first-time-setup checklist validated end-to-end.

**Implications going forward:**
- Daily cron `0 6 * * *` now runs autonomously; expect one PR per day with new items, or silent runs on quiet days.
- DoD #12 from the refined request is satisfied.
- Subsequent runs will only triage *new* items since 2026-05-18 (dedup walks `/news/incoming/` and `/news/published/`).

**Status:** accepted; operational.

## 2026-05-18 — Astro Starlight site verified operational locally

**Decision:** The web UI workstream is acknowledged **OPERATIONAL (local dev)** following the first successful end-to-end build + serve on 2026-05-18. AC1–AC20 all MET per `docs/reference/integration-verification-astro-site.md`. Production hosting remains open in SCOPE.md.

**Why this entry exists:** Mirror of the RSS pipeline operational marker — distinguishes "site coded" from "site working." Phase 10 verifier produced a per-AC verdict table from build/check/audit output; the subsequent `npm run dev` smoke test confirmed live serving on `http://localhost:4321` with the homepage, sidebar (9 entries), audience filter, dark theme, and Pagefind search all working.

**Evidence:**
- `npx astro check` → 0 errors, 0 warnings, 4 cosmetic Zod-4 hints (deferred to a cosmetic refactor).
- `npm run build` → exit 0, 10 pages emitted to `dist/`, Pagefind index built.
- `npm audit --omit=dev` → 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm run dev` → `HTTP 200 OK` on `localhost:4321`; `<h1>NbgAiHub</h1>` + tagline + CTAs rendered; sidebar entries Home/Start Here/Day 1/Week 1/News/Skills/Tips/Glossary/Reference/Contribute all served; expected empty-state warnings logged for empty `news/published/`, `skills/`, `tips/` (graceful fallback per F9).
- Astro v6.3.5 + Starlight v0.39.2 (per A1/A2 supersession).
- Bonus `ConfidenceChip.astro` component added beyond the design's 6 components — additive design refinement to surface the `editor_confidence` frontmatter field on news cards.

**Implications going forward:**
- The site rebuilds live whenever any markdown in `news/published/`, `skills/`, `tips/`, `glossary/`, `journeys/` changes (HMR caveat: cross-folder watching may not always fire — manual reload may be needed).
- 5 of 10 planned glossary terms seeded (claudemd, mcp, skill, plugin, agent).
- Day 1 journey page rendered with placeholder content; 6-step content TBD (separate scope item).
- Production hosting decision (Pro Pages vs Vercel/Netlify/Cloudflare vs defer) remains open in SCOPE.md.

**Status:** accepted; operational locally. Production deploy = follow-up workstream.


## 2026-05-19 — Hub plugin (plan-003) shipped

**Decision:** The `/hub` plugin is **OPERATIONAL** as of 2026-05-19. Eleven `/hub-*` commands (`/hub`, `/hub-search`, `/hub-skills`, `/hub-tips`, `/hub-news`, `/hub-glossary`, `/hub-onboard`, `/hub-install`, `/hub-audience`, `/hub-refresh`, `/hub-open`) ship in a sibling workspace at `plugin/` alongside `pipeline/` and `site/`. Marketplace manifest at repo-root `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` points at `./plugin`; plugin manifest at `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. Bundled content snapshot via `npm run build:snapshot`. Compiled entries via `npm run build` (esbuild ESM, `packages: "external"`).

**Why this entry exists:** Promotion-grade demo target ("hub installable in one command" per SCOPE.md demo checklist). Closes the third workstream after RSS pipeline and Astro site. Inside Claude Code, colleagues can now look up a glossary term, search the hub, browse curated news, or walk an onboarding journey without leaving their terminal.

**Architectural calls (resolved during Phase 3a investigation, not negotiable downstream):**

- **Manifest paths.** Plugin manifest at `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` (not `plugin/plugin.json` — Claude Code spec requires the `.claude-plugin/` subdir). Marketplace manifest at REPO-ROOT `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` (not inside `plugin/`). `source: "./plugin"`.
- **Commands are filesystem-discovered.** No `commands` array in the manifest — Claude Code reads `plugin/commands/*.md`. Each markdown file is an LLM prompt that pre-executes a bundled Node script via `` !`node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/<command>.mjs" $ARGUMENTS` ``. The script's stdout becomes the LLM's context.
- **Per-user state at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/state.json`.** Falls back to `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/claude-code/plugins/nbg-ai-hub/state.json` if env not set. State CANNOT live in the repo — multiple colleagues installing the plugin would clobber each other's audience prefs on every `/hub-refresh`.
- **Plugin config in repo.** `plugin/config.json` (shared) holds default URLs, search weights (title × 5 + topics × 3 + body × 1), snippet length (200), refresh cache path. Travels with the repo across org moves.
- **`/hub-open` defaults to localhost.** `devMode: true` until GH Pages production deploy. `/hub-open` probes `http://localhost:4321` first; instructs user to run `cd site && npm run dev` if dev server isn't up. Flip the flag in `config.json` post-deploy.
- **`/hub-refresh` via `git pull`.** Clones (first run) or `git pull --ff-only --depth 1` (subsequent) into `~/.cache/nbg-ai-hub/snapshot/`. Reuses the user's existing git auth — no separate token needed for the private repo. Atomic update via tmp-clone-then-rename.
- **TS-guard frontmatter validation (not Zod).** Keeps the esbuild bundle small and avoids a runtime dep duplication with the site. The pipeline + site own canonical schema authority; the plugin's validators are 1:1 mirrors that throw `FrontmatterInvalidError` on mismatch.
- **Search: pure TS, no library.** Title × 5 + topics × 3 + body × 1, case-insensitive substring, 200-char snippets centered on first match, ties broken by sourcePath. Upgradeable later if newcomers ask for semantic search.

**Evidence:**

- `cd plugin && npm install` → 210 packages, 0 vulnerabilities.
- `npm test` → **130/130 tests pass** across 13 test files (manifest, errors, snapshot, url-builder, config, state, frontmatter, search, audience, journeys, output, content, plus an end-to-end suite that spawns each compiled `dist/<cmd>.mjs` against the real snapshot).
- `npm run typecheck` → 0 errors.
- `npm run lint` → 0 errors, 0 warnings.
- `npm run build` → 11 bundled entries in `dist/*.mjs` (esbuild ESM, externalized deps).
- `npm run build:snapshot` → bundled 5 glossary + 0 tips + 0 skills + 1 journey + 8 news items into `plugin/snapshot/` with `.snapshot-meta.json`.
- End-to-end smoke against the real snapshot: `/hub` shows the 5-pillar menu with correct counts; `/hub-glossary plugin` returns the definition; `/hub-search claude` returns 13 ranked matches; `/hub-audience advanced` persists to state.json; `/hub-open glossary mcp` resolves to `http://localhost:4321/glossary#mcp`.

**Implications going forward:**

- The hub now has three operational workstreams (pipeline, site, plugin). Promotion demo target met: hub installable from a fresh Claude Code install in one command.
- When new tips/skills land in the repo, `npm run build:snapshot && npm run build` rebuilds the bundled snapshot. The intended release flow: a future GH Action that auto-bumps plugin version on content regeneration.
- `tips/` and `skills/` directories ship empty in this build (per current SCOPE.md). Plugin handles empty pillars gracefully — `/hub-skills` returns "no matching skills" rather than throwing.
- Day-1 journey content is still placeholder; `/hub-onboard day-1` surfaces "[content in progress]" honestly per A20.
- `devMode: true` in `plugin/config.json` remains until GH Pages production deploy. Flip with a one-line edit at deploy time; no plugin republish required if config is read at runtime (current behavior).

**Open follow-ups** (registered in `Issues - Pending Items.md`):
- OQ4: by-role journey slug spellings (`backend`, `data-scientist`, `ml-engineer`) — confirm before authoring content.
- OQ5: confirm Claude Code marketplace install flow against current spec when publishing.
- OQ6: surface `editor_confidence` in `/hub-news` output → DONE (already shipped as `[confidence: high|medium|low]` marker per spec).

**Status:** accepted; operational. Plugin codebase + manifests + snapshot tooling complete.

## 2026-05-19 — Personalization + community contributions: PAT-scoped gist + URL-redirect submissions

**Status:** accepted

**Context:** A brainstorm/refine session converged on adding per-user favourites + a marketplace contribution form, both leveraging GitHub as the backend (no servers, no proxies). The original design — favourites synced via OAuth Device Flow + a `gist`-scoped token, submissions via browser-side fork/branch/PR API choreography — hit a hard CORS wall (the investigator's R1 finding: GitHub's OAuth handshake endpoints `github.com/login/device/code` and `/login/oauth/access_token` do not send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` headers, so a static site cannot complete Device Flow from the browser). The two viable fixes were (a) introduce a Cloudflare Worker proxy or (b) drop OAuth entirely and pivot to a PAT-paste UX for favourites + URL-redirect for submissions. The user picked (b) to keep the project zero-infrastructure.

**Decision:** Use a classic Personal Access Token (PAT) with **`gist` scope only**, pasted into a sign-in modal, for the favourites feature. Favourites are synced via the user's unlisted GitHub gist `nbgaihub-favorites.json` (one file, wrapped JSON shape `{schema_version: 1, favourites: [{type, slug, pinned_at}]}`, read-modify-write protocol with last-write-wins). For skill submissions, use a **GitHub `new file` URL redirect** (`github.com/<owner>/<repo>/new/main/skills?filename=&value=`), not browser-side write APIs — GitHub's own UI handles the fork/branch/PR flow; a CI validator catches malformed entries at PR time.

**Rationale:**
- The original Device Flow + OAuth App design was blocked by R1 (CORS).
- The recommended fix (Cloudflare Worker proxy) was rejected to keep the project zero-deployable-infrastructure. Adding a worker would have been a permanent operational tax for the team.
- PAT-paste reuses GitHub's existing token UI — every user already has a `Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens` page they know how to use. The `gist` scope is **narrower** than the OAuth App's `repo` scope; the blast radius of a compromised PAT is "the user's own gists" rather than "everything in every repo they can write to".
- The gists API supports CORS for browser writes (verified in investigation R3).
- The gist is **unlisted, not private** — anyone with the 32-char hex URL can read it, but the URL is never shared and is practically unguessable. The privacy callout in the gist contract is explicit so users understand this isn't auth-protected storage.
- URL-redirect submissions remove an entire class of API-call failure modes (no auth needed; no fork-then-branch-then-PR API sequence to choreograph in the browser); GitHub's web UI gives a much better author UX than any browser-side implementation would.
- The CI validator catches malformed entries deterministically at PR time — same 17 rules run on the client during form fill, so authors see most errors before submitting.

**Reverses:**
- SCOPE.md "Per-user personalization or bookmarking" — was in "Out of scope — NO", now in MVP-IN.
- SCOPE.md "Community contributions (PRs from outside the team)" — was in "Deferred — LATER", now in MVP-IN.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **OAuth App + Cloudflare Worker proxy** — REJECTED. The worker would terminate the OAuth handshake server-side and re-emit a token to the browser. Technically clean; operationally a permanent piece of infrastructure the team would have to own and rotate keys for. Killed on the "zero deployable infrastructure" promise.
- **User-pasted PAT + local-only favourites (no sync)** — REJECTED. Loses cross-device sync entirely; breaks symmetry with the future Claude-side `/hub-*` skill, which is the whole point of having a stored data contract.
- **Browser-side write APIs for submissions** (`POST /repos/.../forks` + `POST /repos/.../git/refs` + `PUT /repos/.../contents/...` + `POST /repos/.../pulls`) — REJECTED. Would have required the `repo` scope on the PAT (much broader than `gist`); fragile against API rate limits; gives a worse author experience than GitHub's own new-file UI; complicates the failure modes (partial submissions, orphan branches).

**Privacy posture (documented verbatim in the gist contract):**
> Your pins live in an unlisted gist on your own GitHub account — unlisted means anyone with the URL can read it, but the URL is a 32-char hex id and is never shared by NbgAiHub. The site uses your `gist`-scoped token only to read/write that one file. NbgAiHub does not see or store your pins. To fully revoke access, delete the token at github.com/settings/tokens.

The gist is owned by the user, not the project. If the user leaves the org, their pins vanish with them. No aggregation. No team-wide stats. (Opt-in aggregation is parked as a low-priority follow-up in `Issues - Pending Items.md`.)

**References:**
- `docs/reference/investigation-personalization.md` — R1 (CORS) + Topic 2 (unlisted vs private) + the Option C historical section.
- `docs/refined-requests/personalization-and-contributions.md` — refined request reflecting Option C end-to-end.
- `docs/design/plan-003-personalization-and-contributions.md` — 23-step plan executed across waves A–E.
- `docs/design/project-design.md §P` — interface contracts, data models, error classes.
- `docs/reference/gist-contract.md` — wire format shared with the future Claude-side `/hub-*` skill.

**Implementation evidence:** commits `c1df291` (Wave A — foundations), `5a08260` (Wave B — core libs incl. `auth.ts`, `gist.ts`, `submission.ts`, validator), `64f83b2` (Wave C — UI: `SignIn.astro`, `PinButton.astro`, `/my-pins/`, `/submit-skill/`, CI workflow). Site 127 tests; pipeline 112 tests (was 93). Anonymous browsing parity verified.

## 2026-05-19 — Auto-promotion of high-confidence professional-source news items

**Status:** accepted

**Decision:** Variant C — when a triaged item satisfies BOTH (a) `triage.editor_confidence === "high"` AND (b) the originating feed is marked `auto_promote_eligible: true` in `config/rss-sources.json`, the orchestrator writes it directly to `news/published/` and the workflow commits it to `main` without opening an editorial PR. Every other item still routes to `news/incoming/` and is promoted only after human review.

Per-feed eligibility (initial pin):
- `r/ClaudeAI` → `false`
- `r/ClaudeCode` → `false`
- `Hacker News frontpage` → `true`
- `Wired AI` → `true`
- `The Verge` → `true`

The pipeline now emits four step outputs on `$GITHUB_OUTPUT`: `new_items`, `auto_promote_count`, `review_count`, `mode` (`"auto_only" | "mixed" | "review_only" | "empty"`). The workflow has three conditional branches:
- `mode == 'auto_only'` — `git add news/published && git commit && git push origin main` (no PR).
- `mode == 'mixed' || mode == 'review_only'` — branch + `git add news/incoming news/published` + `gh pr create` with the standard PR body. The body now has two top-level sections, "Auto-promoted (n=N)" and "For review (n=M)", each only rendered when non-empty.
- `mode == 'empty'` — no-op.

**Rationale:** PR #5 surfaced that ~half the editorial-review effort goes into rubber-stamping items where both the triage model and the source had already done the work. Reddit + medium/low confidence items are the genuine judgment calls — those still earn human attention. Auto-promote on the easy-win items shrinks reviewer load without removing the human gate where it matters. Cost of the policy: roughly the next-day's PR shrinks to whatever Reddit + medium/low items remain; auto-promoted items become part of the publish stream immediately, eligible for the site's `glob` loader on the next build.

**Reverses:** nothing. SCOPE.md "Curated RSS, not auto-aggregated" still holds — variant C is *not* unconditional auto-promote; it's auto-promote under a conjunction of structural signals (confidence + source class), each individually documented in the prompt + the config.

**Alternatives considered:**
- **Unconditional auto-promote** (rejected — loses the editorial gate entirely; would surface Reddit field-reports unreviewed).
- **Confidence-only auto-promote** (rejected — model rates Reddit posts "high" plenty often; Reddit posts need a second pair of eyes).
- **Source-only auto-promote** (rejected — even professional sources yield off-topic items the model itself flags as low/medium confidence; those should still go through review).
- **Approval-bot auto-merge of the editorial PR** (rejected — same outcome as auto-promote but doubles the GH-Actions cost and adds a PR-bot to the audit trail with no benefit over committing direct to `main`).

**Implementation evidence:** new module `pipeline/src/auto-promote.ts` + `pipeline/tests/auto-promote.test.ts`; `FeedSource.auto_promote_eligible: boolean` is now a required field with no fallback; `config/rss-sources.json` updated with the per-feed flag; `writeNewsItem` takes a `destination: "incoming" | "published"` parameter; `buildPrBody` takes separate `autoPromoted` and `reviewNeeded` arrays; `.github/workflows/rss-triage.yml` has three conditional steps branching on `mode`. Pipeline tests grow 112 → 124. Build + lint + tests green.
